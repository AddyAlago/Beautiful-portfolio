A modern React + Tailwind portfolio site with **production-grade automated testing**.

## ðŸš€ Quality Automation

This project isnâ€™t just a portfolio â€” itâ€™s a demonstration of my QA engineering philosophy:

- âœ… **Playwright E2E tests** covering navigation, section visibility, and contact form.
- âœ… **Accessibility checks (axe-core)** against WCAG 2A/AA, with JSON reports uploaded to CI.
- âœ… **Performance guardrails** to prevent regressions in page load.
- âœ… **CI/CD integration** with GitHub Actions:
  - Runs tests on every push and pull request.
  - Uploads Playwright reports (HTML, traces, screenshots).
  - Publishes `axe-report.json` when accessibility violations are detected.

## ðŸ“Š Test Status Badge

The badge above shows the **live status** of my end-to-end test suite:

- ðŸŸ¢ Green = all tests passing  
- ðŸ”´ Red = failing tests (check Actions tab for details)
